##Introduction

This project is a set of command line scripts that double as Python libraries for creating measurements for RIPE Atlas. It uses the more recent [RESTful API](https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/rest/). 
This project will be most useful for those who prefer to work on the command-line or need a higher level of flexability when issuing and collecting measurements.

If you are looking for a library to assist in parsing Atlas data then please check out the [analysis tools](https://github.com/RIPE-Atlas-Community/ripe-atlas-community-contrib).

The code started off from a very nice tutorial by StÃ©phane Bortzmeyer (http://www.bortzmeyer.org/ripe-atlas-api.html). I continue to use the "authentication key" configuration from the tutorial script.

##Measurement scripts

There are several measurement scripts in place for running traceroute, ping, ssl etc... Most scripts double as Python class modules and command-line scripts. As command-line scripts, each typically takes a probe-target file as the first argument and an output file to write measurement ids as the second argument. The probe-target file is a space-separated probeid, target pair per line such as
```
4125 www.google.com
4156 204.57.0.5
...
```

Measurements are target-centric. When measurements are issued, all probes measuring the same target will be batched together is a single measurement. This reduces load on the RIPE Atlas backend scheduling platform.


Example usage of ping.
```
atlas_ping.py probe-targets-file probe-targets-measurementids
```

Each measurement script has it's own set of independent options so check out the usage output for each one. Measurement ids are also printed to stderr as a status indicator.


##Configure Auth Key
Measurement scripts require an auth key file at ~/.atlas/auth with the key as a single line. Alternatively, a key can be passed as a parameter to most scripts.

##Utilities

###Check status of measurements
```
./atlas_status probe-targets-measurementids
```

###Fetching active probes
```
./fetch_active.py tab true > active_probes
```

###Downloading measurements
This currently relies on GNU parallel. It seems to work with versions >= 20130222 but older versions may have problems. There are other implementations of download commented out in the source if parallel is not available but they will be much slower.

```
./atlas_collect.sh probe-targets-file 4 > results.json 
```

###Stop repeating measurements
```
./stop_measurements.sh probe-targets-measurementids
```

##Dependencies
The atlas client libraries require the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest) library.
